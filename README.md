# Veganlicious

## Technologies
Used Django as my backend server with Postgresql as my database. On the front-end, I implemented React Router with React.js.

## Approach
An app that allows users to add their favorite vegan recipes to share with the vegan community. Sometimes a recipe needs to be changed though, so instead of reading deep into the comments of the blog post or waiting for a response from the blogger, users can add changes or recommendations to any recipe. If there was a recipe that is not already vegan but someone has a good vegan-version of it, this is a great place to upload it! Or if a recipe would be better with a different ingredient or any type of change, any user can also edit that!

### Unsolved Problems/Future Edits
I have not yet added a way to search yet on the backend, and would also like to create a way to add likes or comments in order to filter a search by "most liked".
